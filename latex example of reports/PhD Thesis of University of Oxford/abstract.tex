Many pricing and optimization problems in financial mathematics can be reformulated
in terms of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE). 
They provide a probabilistic representation of solutions of nonlinear parabolic PDEs, generalizing then the Feynman-Kac formula. 
We are interested on solving numerically BSDEs applied to financial problems.
